2. [data](https://github.com/anntanp/ddb-fg-ner/tree/main/data) contains the annotated dataset.
   - [REF.json](https://github.com/anntanp/ddb-fg-ner/blob/main/data/REF.json) contains the list of all titles, including URLs to the objects published in the German Digital Library or *Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek* (DDB).
   - [5-fold/] (https://github.com/anntanp/ddb-fg-ner/tree/main/data/5-fold) folder contains *train*, *validation*, and *test* splits used for the 5-fold validation.
3. [notebooks](https://github.com/anntanp/ddb-fg-ner/tree/main/notebooks) contains Jupyter notebooks used for all the experiments.
    - \*FT_NER\* contains Python code used for the fine-tuning experiments.
    - \*TPDL <model>\* contains Python code used for prompting LLM models.
4. [results](https://github.com/anntanp/ddb-fg-ner/tree/main/results) contains scores and other statistics summarized from the notebooks.
    - [nervaluate_ft_results/](https://github.com/anntanp/ddb-fg-ner/tree/main/results/nervaluate_ft_results) contains summarized statistics from fine-tuning experiments.
